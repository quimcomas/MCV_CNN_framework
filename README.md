# Scene Understanding for Autonomous Vehicles

M5 Visual Recognition - Master in Computer Vision, UAB

### Abstract

The goal of this project is to learn the basic concepts and technniques related to scene understanding for autonomous vehicles. The project is divided in three main parts: Object Recognition, Object Detection and Image Semantic Segmentation.

### Week 2

The goal of this week 2 is to learn to classify images using state of the art neural networks. To evaluate and perform our image classifition we used two main datasets:

- Tsinghua-Tencent 100K (TT100K)
- Kitti 

Tasks done during these weeks:

- [x] Run the provided code (analize the dataset and evaluate on train, validation and test set). 
- [x] Read two papers and summarize them (VGG and SqueezeNet). 
- [x] Implement a new network using an existing implementation (Resnet152 implementation).
- [x] Train our networks for another dataset (we used kitti dataset).
- [x] Boost the performance of our network (we boosted the performance of Resnet152).

### Week 3/4

The goal of the weeks 3 and 4 is to segment each object of the scene giving its associated label. To evaluate and perform our image semantic segmentation we used different datasets:

- Camvid
- Kitti
- Cityscapes
- Synthia 
- Pascal 12

Tasks done during these weeks:

- [x] Run the provided code (analize the dataset and evaluate on train, validation and test set). 
- [x] Read two papers and summarize them (Long et al. CVPR, 2015 and O. Ronneberger, P. Fischer, and T. Brox). 
- [x] Implement a new network using an existing implementation (Unet implementation).
- [x] Implement a new network using our own implementation (FastNet).
- [x] Train our networks for another dataset (we used all the datasets available).
- [x] Boost the performance of our network (we boosted the performance of our own implementation and Unet).
